## Game's Name: 2-Player Hangman

### Description

2-Player Hangman is a classic word-guessing game in this version is the software whom selects a word, and two players compete to guess it. Players take turns guessing letters, and if a player misses more than 7 times, he lose the game, if the word is guessed the player with more guessed letters wins. This game provides an engaging way for two players to interact and challenge each otherâ€™s vocabulary skills.

I chose this game because of its simple yet entertaining nature, and it provides a great way to practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills.
